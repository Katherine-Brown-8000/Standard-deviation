# Standard-deviation
The method for calculating standard deviation changes depending wheather your calculating from the population or a sample.

If you are unsure of what method the code your using is doing you can enter -1, 1 into the list. If 1 is returned the code is calculating for population standard deviation, if it returns 1.41... than it is calculating for sample standard deviation.
